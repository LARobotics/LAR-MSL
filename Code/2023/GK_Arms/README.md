This repository is dedicated for the goal keeper moving parts.

For the moving parts to move, it is used a raspberry pi pico to control the motor (main.py).

The import.py is the file that sends via serial the command for the pi pico to activate the motor.

This repository contains a tutorial of how to install and use Thonny (IDE for raspberry pi pico)
